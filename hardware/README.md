The hardware section is structured as follows:

- design, that contains the schematic and the board layout;
- cam, that contains the CAM outputs of the whole board, comprising gerbers and drill files.
- gcodes, that contains all the gcodes needed to execute the board machining with The Ant (see [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX44z-SSL7LzcB4xxgUdHHA)).

Before using the gcode files, read carefully the README in the gcodes folder.
